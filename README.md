# Professional Identity - First Steps

Hi there!

I'm Jasmine, a computer engineering undergraduate student at Unicamp. This year - 2024 -, I've decided to establish my professional identity online to reach new people, make connections, exchange knowledge and showcase my work and interests in an organized and precise manner, 
The most frequent topics I discuss are listed and detailed in the topics below.

### Woman's Programming Contest

I'm very comitted with the female cause in computer science and engineering. As such, I the founded, created and currently serve as president of the Woman's Programming Contest in Brazil (Maratona Feminina de Programação - MFP).
MFP is an event that, nowadays, belongs to the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC), of which I'm an effective member. Its impact has reached thousands of women and non-binary people throughout Latin America.
This achievement has been life-changing for me, as it has provided the oppotunity of [finally] being able to enact meaningful change in the computer science field and STEM in general.
Throughout this journey - or, as I'd rather say, odyssey -, I've been constinuously learning and growing. This includes developing leadership skills, honing critical thinking, mastering problem solving techniques and refining my skills in tools and teams management. It's a so meaningful experience that I created my professional profile, initially, to register the huge amount of valuable knowledge I'm having the pleasure to acquire.
I like to call my learning journey an odyssey because I really do appreciate transparency and honesty in my endeavors. Therefore, I'm commited to sharing not only the successes but also the arduous, demanding and "dark" moments of my journey (e.g. times I fail, struggle etc). I believe that's the right way to show my work and to empower others to realize their own capabilities.

### Social Causes and Philosophies such as the Open Source Movement

All my dedication and work are strongly grounded on philosophies I believe to be the right way to make computer science. I'm still in the learning process and eagerly embrace new ideologies thar promote a socially responsible and good use of technology.
A highlight in my dedication is the efforts of being cautelous with mental health and spreading information about it - spaning from my role as a diligent student to my responsabilities as the president of an international event.

### Learning and Teaching entusiast

As an olympiad medallist and entusiast, I've always been into learning new things and gaining knowledge. I fin myself drawn to math and programming problems, and I feel really happy when I'm finally able to solve them. I'm pesistent - even though sometimes I'm fail or struggle with the dedication demanded -, and, frequently, I gain a new perspective on some aspect of life because of a certain knowledge I've acquired.
In addition, I love teaching and witnessing other people go through this experience. I've already been a teacher in a popular course and monitored a few projects.
Overall, I frequently search and share random apprenticeships I've learned, in a way to inform others and instigate the habit of trying to understand the world around them, as well as develop their own opinions and go against the heavily entrenched utilitarism.
I've actually taken a long time to be able to recognize the value of this process; so, now, I try to share it as most as possible.
Along the way, I've already learned (some of them I'm still in the learning process) stuff like: Braille (writing system), Morse Code, Pixel Art, Realistic Drawing, German Basics, Graphic Design and the list goes on... (I hope it gets much bigger!)

#### I'm really excited to share this journey! See you!
