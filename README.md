# Professional Identity - First Steps

Hi there!

I'm Jasmine, a computer engineering undergraduate student at Unicamp. This year - 2024 -, I've decided to create my professional identity on internet, so I would be able to reach new people, make new connections, exchange knowledge and show, in an organized and precise way, my work and interests.
The most frequent topic I'm used to aboard are listed and detailed in the topics below.

### Woman's Programming Contest

I'm very comitted with the female cause in computer science and engineering. Thus, I'm the founder, creator and president of the Woman's Programming Contest in Brazil (Maratona Feminina de Programação - MFP).
MFP is an event that, nowadays, belongs to Brazilian Computer Society (SBC), at which I'm and effective member. It has impacted thousands of women and non-binary people all over Latin-America.
This achievement has been a live-changing experience, from which I feel I'm finally being able to provide changes in the computer science area and STEM in general.
I've beem learning a lot in this journey - or odyssey, as I'd rather say -, including leadership skills, critical thinking, problem solving, tools and teams management, and many other stuff. It's a so meaningful experience that I created my professional profile, initially, to register the huge amount of valuable things I'm having the pleasure to learn.
I like to call my learning journey an odyssey because I really do appreciate transparency and honesty in my registers, so I'm going to bring, also, the arduous, demandous and "dark" sides of my journey (e.g. moments I fail, struggle etc). I believe that's the right way to show your job and to let other people know they're capable too.

### Social Causes and Philosophies such as the Open Source Movement

All my dedication and work are strongly based on phisolophies I believe to be the right way to do computer sciencie. I'm still in the learning process and excited about learning new ideologies to make a socially good use of technology.
A highlight in my dedication are the efforts of being cautelous with mental health and spreading information about it - since my job as a mere student, until my duties as an international event president.

### Learning and Teaching entusiast

As an olympiad medallist and entusiast, I've always been into learning new things and gaining knowledge. I'm addicted to math and programming problems, and I feel really happy when I'm finally able to solve them. I'm pesistent - even though sometimes I'm fail or struggle with the dedication demanded -, and, frequently, gain a new perspective of seeing some life aspect because of a certain knowledge obtained.
In addition, I love teaching and seeing other people going through this experience. I've already been a teacher in a popular course and monitored a few projects.
Overall, I frequently search and share random apprenticeships I've learned, in a way to inform others and instigate the habit of trying to understand the world around us and develop their own opinions, and to go against the so consolidated utilitarism.
I've actually taken a long time to be able to see the valuability of this process; so I try to share it as most as I can.
In this process, I've already learned (some of them I'm still in the learning process) stuff like: Braille (writing system), Morse Code, Pixel Art, Realistic Drawing, German Basics, Graphic Design and the list goes on... (I hope it gets much bigger!)

#### I'm really excited to share this journey! See you!
